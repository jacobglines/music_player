Programming 2 Final using PyQt5 to make a music player

---------------------------------------------------------
WHAT?

This is an app that's work like a music player (similar to iTune). The app was created as Jabob and I's final project for te school year.
It works just like a nor mal music player except that it doesn't have the option to repeat song nor download songs directly from the 
internet. To play songs is maybe the only purpose of this app. This app was created using mostly PyQt 5 to design layout, and play songs.
Beside the package, there was no other dependencies required.

---------------------------------------------------------
HOW?

In order to use the app, firstly, the user will click the "File" option on the Menu bar on top and choose songs and pull them down to the 
app from their computer's directoty. Only MP3 and WAV files are receivable. After having all the songs pulled down, the user will play
the song exactly the way normal music players do. 

Special note:
Single-click songs: play songs
Double-click songs: create playlist or add the songs to playlist
After using the search bar, click "all songs" button to return to the list of songs
Space: play short-cut
Alt+Right: next song short-cut
Alt-Left: previous song short-cut
Return: search
---------------------------------------------------------
PROBLEMS (BUGS):

This Music Player app is not sompletely the same as the others. Due to the lack of time, we couldn't add in the repeat-song feature like
other Misic Players have. Also, the users are not able to download songs from the internet and pull them directly down to the app, but have
to download the songs to their computer and then pull them down to the app and I admit that it's less convinient for the users. 

Also, depend on which kind of computer (Macs or Windows), the codes of the app will work differently. Therefore, the users might have to 
change some codes in order to get the program to work.
